    <h4>STEPS IN MAKING JAKE'S SPECIALTY</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda in a
        mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk the melted butter and buttermilk
        together, then add the egg.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the flour mixture with the buttermilk mixture and whisk until
        they're combined and free of lumps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt some additional butter on a large skillet, and add bacon strips
        with space between each. Pour the batter down each bacon strip until it
        is covered. Make sure to leave space between each cake!
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook until the batter bubbles, then flip. Serve the pancakes drizzled
        with maple syrup.
