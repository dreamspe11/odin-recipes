    <h4>HOW TO MAKE A KRABBY PATTY</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the aioli.</strong> Combine the mayonnaise with Old Bay
        Seasoning in a small bowl. Once they're fully mixed, set the sauce
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the patties.</strong> In a large bowl, add the ground beef,
        Old Bay Seasoning, and salt. Mix thoroughly until everything combines,
        then shape the mixture into four burger patties.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cut out the cheese.</strong> After the patties are cooked
        through, using a star-shaped cookie cutter, cut out the cheese. Place
        the cheese stars on top of the hot patties and let the cheese melt for
        30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble the krabby patties.</strong> Spread the aioli from the
        first step over the bottom half of the buns. Place the hamburgers on
        top, followed by lettuce, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, and
        pickles. Close it with the top bun, serve, and enjoy!
